what is language ? 
--------------------------------
language is a way to communicate 

------------------------------
Compiler : which is compile whole source file and give output after completion of source file. 

Interpreter : it execute line by line 

    line by line it send code to machine - and machine convert into human code and resend to user. 

    Interpreter is slower than Compiler.

what is meaning of program ? 

program is a collection of instruction code. 

-------------------------------------
what is meaning of programing language ? 

A language which is used to write a program. 

-------------------------------------------------
example of programing languages ?


C language , C++ language , java , python , php , .net c#(c-sharp) ...

what is c programing language ? 

C is a most powerfull , popular  compiler type programing language. 
C is easy to understand. 
C language was invented by denis m. ritchie in AT and T bell lab. 

----------------------------------------------------------
History of C programing : 

Before C programing there is BCPL language then B language and then after C language 

C language is a better version of B language. 

actually BCPL and B language working upon assembly language so, it difficult to understand
so, denis m ritchie invented C programing language in 1972  (tranditional C programing).

in 1989 ANSI standarized C programing 

ANSI : American national standard institute. 

after standarized of c programing its know as ANSI C , C89 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features of C programing language 

=> C language is a easy to understand programing language - mother of all programing language. 

=> C is small because it contains only 32 keywords 

=> C contains libaries 

=====================================
Real world uses of C language 

operating system 
embedded system 
games 
kernels 
drivers

Structure of C program 

1) documentation of program 

        which represent your program's title or description 
        which is represent by comments 

        compiler skip or ignore comments at executation time 

        there are 2 types of comments 

        i) single line comment  : which is represent by // 

            e.g. 

                // this is single line comment
        ii) multi-line comment  : which is represent by /*  ...  */ 

            e.g.  

                /* 
                    this is 
                    my multiline 
                        comment 

                */ 

2) connection with C language libary 

#include<stdio.h> 
#include<conio.h>   // optional 

        here,  # : which means predefined 

               include : to add something 

               <stdio.h> : standard input output header file 

                        using of this header file we can access inbuilt function from this file 

                <conio.h> : console input output header file. 


3) executation of program

void main()
{

}


    /* here, void is a data type which does not return value. 

        main : main is a function which is represent that this a 
               main executatable function of program 

        {

        }

       { }  this is represent block of code . 

    */
