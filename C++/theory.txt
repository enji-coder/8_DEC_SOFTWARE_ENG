what is c++ : 

    c++ is an extend version of c language 

    C language + 1 

    c + 1 

    it showing postfix increment 

--------------------------
oop concept's pillers

-> class 
-> object 
-> inheritance 
-> encapsulation
-> polymorphism
-> abstraction 
-> Aggregation 

------------------------------------------
POP vs OOP : 

    procedure oriented programing 

    which is mainly focus on functions. 

    our all programs divide in chunks of functions 

OOP : 

    object oriented programing language 

    -> everythings depends on object 
    
------------------------------------------
OOPS : object oriented programing system 

class : class is a collection of different different data members 

    class is a blueprint of object 
   
    class is a collection of elements 

    class is a userdefined datatype

    syntax :
    class <classname>()
    {
        public:
            data member;
            member function();
    };

--------------------------------------------------
object : object is an instance of class. or we can say that 
    object is a variable of class. 

    using of object we can access properties of class. 

    syntax : 

    classname  objname = classname();
--------------------------------------------------
constructor : constructor is a most powerfull concept of c++ 
    constructor is a special member function 
    or we can say that constructor is a special method 

    which is invoke automatically whenever we create object of class. 

    it is usually work for initilization of member. 

    note : constructor does not have any return type 
        and constructor always declare in public mode. 

    constructor name and classname both are same we can't take \
    different as a constructor. 

    syntax : 

    class <classname>
    {
        constructor:
            body of constructor
    }

--------------------------------------------------
there are mainly 3 types of constructor 

1) default constructor 
2) parameterized constructor
3) copy constructor

---------------------------
1) default constructor : does not contain any parameter 
    when we want to display or do some static value 
    we can use default constructor

2) parameterized constructor : when we pass parameter 
    at object creation time its called parameterized 
    constructor.

    
--------------------------------------------------
this pointer : this pointer which is refer current class object 

    means we can define current class member using of this pointer

--------------------------------------------------

3) copy constructor : copy constructor is a special constructor which 
        create new object using of existing object. 

        syntax :

        constructorname   (const classname  &obj)
        {
            ..
        }

        here  & means address operator 


--------------------------------------------------
pass by value :  function parameter we are passing only object 
    it will not affect original value 

        - we are passing value here only 

pass by reference : we are passing reference of object 
    so, whenever we apply change it affect original value 

        - we are passing original object 

pass by address - pointer concept 

        here, we pass address of object so, whenever we apply changes in address it affect 
        original value 
        
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------
inheritance : 

    inheritance is a most powerfull concept of oops concepts 

    -> inheritance provide reusability - so, we can reduce our work and save development time 

    -> inheritance provide parent and child relationalship 

    there are 5 types of inheritance 

    1) single level inheritance
    2) multi-level inheritance 
    3) multiple inheritance
    4) hierarchical inheritance
    5) hybrid inheritance

    -> inheritance is a part of relationalship so, it represent IS-A relationalship


    parent - child   (100% utility of parent's properties.)

----------------------------------------------
1) single level inheritance:

        when parent and child in relationalship its called single level inheritance

        A   (parent)
        |
        V 
        B   (child)

    syntax : 

    class parentclass 
    {

    };
    class childclass : <accessSpecifier>  <parentclass> 
    {

    };


-----------------------------------------------------
Access Specifiers or visibility modes 

there are 3 types of Access Specifiers 

1) public 
2) private 
3) protected 

-------------------------------------------------------
in structure by default all members are public but in class 
by default all members are private so, we have to 
define in public mode. 

-> public : we can access class properties from anywhere inside the and outside
            the class. 

        -> anywhere from the program 
-> private : private means private data - we can't access outside the class 
        even child class can't user private class data member and member function 

        so, private provide data protection and data hiding in class functionality

        -> only own class can access 

-> protected : protected is similar like private but protected member 
        can access by own class and child class. 

        -> own class and child class 

-------------------------------------------------------
2) multi-level inheritance: 

        Extended level of multi level inheritance: 

        class A                         // class A is a super class or Base class or Parent class 
        {

        };
        class B : public <parentclass>  // class B is a intermediate parent class  
        {

        };
        class C : public  <parentclass> // class C is a sub class or derived class or Child class 
        {

        };
-----------------------------------------------------
3) Multiple inheritance : 

        in this inheritance there are more than one parent class and one child class 

        means one child can have more than one parent or we can say that multiple parent 
        class 

        but in real world multiple inheritance not supported because in 
        real world two parents not possible thats why java does'not support this concept 

        multiple inheritance the main aim to achieve multiple parent's functionality in 
        one child class 


        syntax : 

        class  parent1 
        {

        };
        class  parent2
        {

        };
        class Child : <accessSpecifier>  parent1 , <accessSpecifier> parent2 
        {

        };

        but there are possiblility of Ambiguty (confusion between same name properties)
        
====================================================================
there is one issue or we can say problem with multiple inheritance

ambigity : Ambiguty means when both parents have same name methods and child import 
        (inherite) , it generate confusion its called Ambiguty. 

        unfortunatlly child have 2 same name methods so, compiler get confuse which method 
        i have to access first. 


-------------------------------------------------------
::   this is scope resolution operator means 
    which class properties you want to access it 

====================================================================
hierarchical inheritance : 


                A 
                |
                V 
        --------------------
        |                   |
        V                   V 
        B                   C  


    when one parent have multiple child class. 
====================================================================
5) hybrid inheritance: 

        most complicated inheritance

        because it represent like diamond - and it create Ambiguty

        in simple language we can say that hybrid inheritance
        is a combination of multiple and hierarchical inheritance

                 A 
                 |
            -----------
            |          |
            B          C 
            \         /  
              \      /
               \    /
                 D 

    or 


            A 
            |
    ---------------------
    |                   |
    B                   C 
    |                   |
    --------------------
             |
             D 
--------------------------------------
to resolve diamond problem we can use virtual keyword 

now, virtual keyword inform compiler that you don't have to create 
separate copy of parent class insted of separate copy you can 
pass duplicate copy so, it remove ambiguty

------------------------------------------------
destrcutor : destrcutor mainly work to destroy object 
        whenever we close our block it automatically destroy object after use. 

        same like constructor declare in public mode as destructor declare in public mode 

        but in destructor we have to add ~ sign in prefix and same name as class name 

        syntax : 

        ~classname
        {
            // body of destructor 
        }

------------------------------------------------
encapsulation : so sounds like capsule 

    encapsulation is a most powerfull concept of oop concept which bind 
    different different data member and member functions in single entity 
    and provide data hiding from outside the world. 

    encapsulation concept is achhieve by class and object example. 

--------------------------------------------------------
polymorphism : poly means many and morphism means forms 

    one named method has different forms its called polymorphism 

    polymorphism is derived from greek word means one class can contain same 
    name multiple methods 

there are 2 types of polymorphism
1) method overloading  - compile time polymorphism 
2) method overriding   - run time polymorphism

-----------------------------------
1)  Compile Time polymorphism : 
    which is also know as early binding and static polymorphism

    which is achieve by method overloading and operator overloading 


2) run time polymorphism : 
    which is also known as late binding and dynamic polymorphism
    
    which is acheive by method overriding (inheritance ) and virtual function . 

------------------------------------------------
Method overloading : 

        when one class can contain same name multiple methods its called 

        method overloading. 

        Product 
            -> clickEvent 
                    (image)
                    (button)
                    (text)

        note : same name method with different signature (different parameters)

=======================================================
Method overriding : 
        when parent and child both have same name method and same name arguments its called 
        method overriding 

        syntax : 

        class  Parent 
        {
            void display()
            {

            }
        } ;   
        class Child(Parent)
        {
            void display()
            {

            }
        };
=========================================================
Abstraction : Abstraction is a concept which provide only 
few information not allocated background information 

    the main aim of abstraction concept is to achieve data hiding 
    and hide implementation. 

    abstraction is a concept which is only achieve by abstract class and 
    abstract method 


-> abstract method / pure virtual function :

        pure virtual function means function does not contain implementation 

        abstract method which is indicate by pure virtual function means without 
        body only method declaration. 

        syntax : 

            virtual  <returntype>  funname() = 0;

                        A (house)
                        | 
                        V 
                -------------------
                |                   | 
                B                   C  

        at the time of inheritance there is no data hiding between two child. 
        so, resolve this situation we can use abstraction concept here 

-> abstract class : 

        A class which can contain abstract method its called abstract class. 
=========================================================================
Aggregation : Aggregation is a part of relationship 

        inheritance provide IS - A relationship 

        Aggregation provide HAS- A relationship 

        IS- A relationship :   parent is connected with child 
                    (100 % inherite)

        HAS - A relationship : Department has staff 
                    ( we are use properties of another class using of reference insted of inherite)

---------------------------------------------------------
Student                     

    - name 
    - score 
    - city 
    - state 
    - pincode 

emp : 

    - name 
    - department 
    - city 
    - state 
    - pincode 

---------------------------------------------------------
friend function : friend function is a special member function 
        which can access private member outside the class. 

        friend function declare with using of friend keyword 

        syntax : 

        friend  <returntype>  <funname> (classname  obj);
