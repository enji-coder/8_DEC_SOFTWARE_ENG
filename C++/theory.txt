what is c++ : 

    c++ is an extend version of c language 

    C language + 1 

    c + 1 

    it showing postfix increment 

------------------------------------------
POP vs OOP : 

    procedure oriented programing 

    which is mainly focus on functions. 

    our all programs divide in chunks of functions 

OOP : 

    object oriented programing language 

    -> everythings depends on object 
    
------------------------------------------
OOPS : object oriented programing system 

class : class is a collection of different different data members 

    class is a blueprint of object 
   
    class is a collection of elements 

    class is a userdefined datatype

    syntax :
    class <classname>()
    {
        public:
            data member;
            member function();
    };

--------------------------------------------------
object : object is an instance of class. or we can say that 
    object is a variable of class. 

    using of object we can access properties of class. 

    syntax : 

    classname  objname = classname();
--------------------------------------------------
constructor : constructor is a most powerfull concept of c++ 
    constructor is a special member function 
    or we can say that constructor is a special method 

    which is invoke automatically whenever we create object of class. 

    it is usually work for initilization of member. 

    note : constructor does not have any return type 
        and constructor always declare in public mode. 

    constructor name and classname both are same we can't take \
    different as a constructor. 

    syntax : 

    class <classname>
    {
        constructor:
            body of constructor
    }

--------------------------------------------------
there are mainly 3 types of constructor 

1) default constructor 
2) parameterized constructor
3) copy constructor

---------------------------
1) default constructor : does not contain any parameter 
    when we want to display or do some static value 
    we can use default constructor

2) parameterized constructor : when we pass parameter 
    at object creation time its called parameterized 
    constructor.

    
--------------------------------------------------
this pointer : this pointer which is refer current class object 

    means we can define current class member using of this pointer

--------------------------------------------------

3) copy constructor : copy constructor is a special constructor which 
        create new object using of existing object. 

        syntax :

        constructorname   (const classname  &obj)
        {
            ..
        }

        here  & means address operator 


--------------------------------------------------
pass by value :  function parameter we are passing only object 
    it will not affect original value 

        - we are passing value here only 

pass by reference : we are passing reference of object 
    so, whenever we apply change it affect original value 

        - we are passing original object 

pass by address - pointer concept 

        here, we pass address of object so, whenever we apply changes in address it affect 
        original value
