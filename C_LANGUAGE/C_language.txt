what is language ? 
--------------------------------
language is a way to communicate 

------------------------------
Compiler : which is compile whole source file and give output after completion of source file. 

Interpreter : it execute line by line 

    line by line it send code to machine - and machine convert into human code and resend to user. 

    Interpreter is slower than Compiler. 

-------------------------------------
what is meaning of program ? 

program is a collection of instruction code. 

-------------------------------------
what is meaning of programing language ? 

A language which is used to write a program. 

-------------------------------------------------
example of programing languages ?


C language , C++ language , java , python , php , .net c#(c-sharp) ... 

---------------------------------------------------
what is c programing language ? 

C is a most powerfull , popular  compiler type programing language. 
C is easy to understand. 
C language was invented by denis m. ritchie in AT and T bell lab. 

----------------------------------------------------------
History of C programing : 

Before C programing there is BCPL language then B language and then after C language 

C language is a better version of B language. 

actually BCPL and B language working upon assembly language so, it difficult to understand
so, denis m ritchie invented C programing language in 1972  (tranditional C programing).

in 1989 ANSI standarized C programing 

ANSI : American national standard institute. 

after standarized of c programing its know as ANSI C , C89 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features of C programing language 

=> C language is a easy to understand programing language - mother of all programing language. 

=> C is small because it contains only 32 keywords 

=> C contains libaries 

=====================================
Real world uses of C language 

operating system 
embedded system 
games 
kernels 
drivers 

===================================================
Structure of C program 

1) documentation of program 

        which represent your program's title or description 
        which is represent by comments 

        compiler skip or ignore comments at executation time 

        there are 2 types of comments 

        i) single line comment  : which is represent by // 

            e.g. 

                // this is single line comment
        ii) multi-line comment  : which is represent by /*  ...  */ 

            e.g.  

                /* 
                    this is 
                    my multiline 
                        comment 

                */ 

2) connection with C language libary 

#include<stdio.h> 
#include<conio.h>   // optional 

        here,  # : which means predefined 

               include : to add something 

               <stdio.h> : standard input output header file 

                        using of this header file we can access inbuilt function from this file 

                <conio.h> : console input output header file. 


3) executation of program

void main()
{

}


    /* here, void is a data type which does not return value. 

        main : main is a function which is represent that this a 
               main executatable function of program 

        {

        }

       { }  this is represent block of code . 

    */
        

----------------------------------
printf() : 

    in c language printf is a function which is used to 
    display message on output (console screen)

    syntax : 

    printf("message");

;   semicolon which is indicate end of the line 

    it is used to terminate statement 

by default printf function join with previous function 
--------------------------------------------------------
escapse sequence : 

    \n  : new line 
    \t  : tab 
    \'  : to display single quote 
    \"  : to display double quote 
    \\  : to display slash 

-----------------------------------------------
datatype : which type of value store in a variable its called 
    datatype. 


                            Values 
                              |
                              V 
    numbers                                         characters                  yes/no 
      |
-----------------                                   -------------                  -------
|               |                                   |           |                       |
without        with point                      single char     string                (boolean)
point           

e.g. 15          150.50                        e.g  'A'         "hello"             true/false

int  (%d)       float   (%f)                    char            char[size]          bool
(integer)       double  (%lf)                   %c               %s 
                long double  (%Lf)

            
-------------------------------------------------------------------
variable : variable is name which can store a value. 

    in c language we can take any name as a variable 

    but there are some rules which we have to follow 

    variable devide in 3 steps 

    1) variable declaration : 

        before use with variable we must have to declare with specific data type. 

        syntax :   <datatype>   variablename;

    2) variable initlization: 

        assign a value 

        syntax :  variablename = value; 

    3) variable calling or variable use 

        syntax : printf(variablename)

        
-----------------------------------------
Token : in C language token is a piece of code or we can say that 
        identity of code. 


1) Keywords : keywords are reserved word 
        which is writtern in small letters 

        keywords mainly defined by system which we can use for specific purpose 

        there are 32 keywords in C language/ 

        Note : IN C language we can't take any keyword as a variable name. 

        e.g.   int  int = 10;   X 

        bcs , here int is a keyword 

2) Identifier : Identifier which means anything which is identifiy something 

    like a variable , function , arrays or anything 

        so, in simple language we can say that identifier indetify something in program. 

3) constant : constant means fix value 
        which does not change in program 

        at programing time sometime we want to fix some values 

        e.g.   const float pi = 3.14;  Fix value 

4) operator : a specific symbols which is represent to perform some operations 

        like , +  -  *   /   and many more 

5) specialy characters :   ,  ;  []   () all these are speciall characters. 

=====================================================
variable rules : 

1) variable name can be contain A to Z or a to z or 0 - 9 

2) variable name cannot start with digits (0-9)

3) variable name cannot contain whitespace 

                int  num 1;   X

4) we can't use any special characters in variable name 

        but we can use only underscore 

            e.g  int roll_num; 

5) Any reserved word or a keyword we can't take as a variable name. 

        e.g.  int  int;   X 
        

=====================================================
printf(): to print value on output screen 

scanf() : which is mainly use for accept value at run time 

    or simple language we can say that scanf use to read value from user. 

    syntax : scanf(placeholder,variable);


=====================================================
accept float value from user 

syntax : 

    scanf("%f",&var);

=====================================================
operators : there is some specific symbol which is mainly used to perform operations 

    using of that operators we can perform operations 

    e.g..   number1 + number2; 

    here, number1 and number2 are operands 

    + is an operator sign or symbol 

1) Airthmetic operator : 

    to perform Airthmetic operations we need to user Airthmetic operators 

    +   -    *   /   %
